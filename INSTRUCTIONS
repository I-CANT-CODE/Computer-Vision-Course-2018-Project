Some Basic instructions for how to use these scripts:

Experiment 1:

Wanted to show that training against a multiagent is beneficial vs training against the hard coded player based on if statements

- DQN_TRAINING_LEFT_PLAYER & DQN_TRAINING_RIGHT_PLAYER train Basic DQN RL Models against a hard coded players
- DQN_MULTIAGENT_TRAINING_NORMAL trains two Basic DQN Models against eachother
- DQN_MULTIAGENT_ASSESMENT Loads in any Two DQN Models by name and has them compete in games of pong and records the scores
- Recommended: run these programs in the above order, and then load in the models in the assesment program to see how they do.

Experiament 2:

Wanted to see how the Dueling DQN architecture does against the classic DQN architecture

- this is done by running DQN_MULTI_AGENT_TRAINING_MULTIPLE_ARCHITECTURES and observing rewards over time



**for all programs you can graph the rewards over time while the program is running by hitting the down key
